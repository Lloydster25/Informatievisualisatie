    "Democracy, (mental) health access, educational access are living conditions that are associated to be indicators of mental health. Many would say that an increase of these factors should lead to an increase of mental health, yet deeper analysis of these factors might lead to surprising conclusions. This data story will revolve around the inherent correlations between human development and suicide. Human development is a broad term, but it shall be analysed it based on three common indices, and seperated into three perspectives, which will be supported with 2/3 visualizations each. The Red Thread throughout the data story is the Humand Development Index (HDI), which is an index from 0 to 1 (low-high) that is based on education, life expectancy, and GDP per capita (income). Perspective 1 (Awareness Perspective) will revolve around how awareness (through phychiatrists/100k civilians) and the HDI in general influence national suicide rates. Perspective 2 (Sex perspectives) will delve deeper into correlations between the sexes (male/female), and analyse how an increase of the HDI might influence both. Aside from this, the Gender Development Index (GDI) will be introduced and analysed in the same way. Perspective 3 (Political Perspective) focuses on how political influences (government type, democracy, political violence) could influence national suicide (including a correlation between political indices and the HDI)."

The HDI is a value between 0 and 1 (low-high) that indicates human development by looking at health, education, and standard of living. The database contains each variable that is considered for the HDI value, but we are only interested in the HDI values themselves. Thus, as for preprocessing, all columns except the country and its HDI value are removed. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/undp/human-development?select=human_development.csv\n",

The GDI is also a value between 0 and 1 (low-high), that indicates equality in human development specifically between male and female. To clarify, the higher the gender equality, the higher the GDI value will be. Similarly to the preprocessing of database one, will all rows except the country and its GDI value be removed. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/undp/human-development?select=human_development.csv\n",

Databases 1,2,3 are then merged together into Dataset 1, and the columns are renamed to more practical names. Rows that include one or more ‘empty’ values are removed from the dataset.

Then it is seperated into a female suicide dataset (dataset 2) and a male suicide dataset (dataset 3). This had to be done by changing the tags for 'female' and 'male' to FeM and Male (using str.contains() and str.replace()), as database 4 must have included some white spacing in between the tags, making it inpossible to simply seperate for 'female' and 'male'.

Seven countries from database 5 are renamed so that they can be correctly merged with dataset 1. For each country, the most recently included datapoint (by year) is selected, and then the year is dropped from the dataset.

This, in turn, contributes to a higher prevalence of individuals experiencing difficulties in finding meaning and fulfillment, potentially increasing the likelihood of suicidal thoughts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the observed relationship between HDI and suicide rates suggests that the availability of education and economic opportunities plays a crucial role in individuals' well-being and mental health. Enhancing educational systems and promoting economic growth in regions with lower HDI values could potentially contribute to reducing the incidence of suicidal thoughts and improving overall quality of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall, the relationship between HDI and suicide rates is complex. There are many other factors that contribute to this relationship, such as cultural or social aspects.**\n"

    "This part of the data story, will look at the relationship between the Gender Development Index (GDI), the HDI, and suicide rates. Equility between male and female living conditions is generally considered as a sign of a country's development, and is thus within the scope of our analysis. The Gender Development Index (GDI) stipulates the differences in the HDI for men and women. Contrary to the HDI, the GDI is able to raise above 1.0, which indicates a higher HDI for women, whereas a score below 1.0 means a higher HDI for men. Despite the idea that the GDI supports development, we expect there to be large differences in how they effect male- and female suicides."

    "Firstly, the most logical correlation we expect to see is that with an increase of GDI, the female suicides will marginally drop. The explanation for this seems obvious, as with a global history of better living conditions for men, female improvement in quality of life should follow with an increase of a higher GDI, which would lead to a drop in suicides. For men, however, the suicides are expected to increase as, aside from better living conditions for women, an increase of GDI might also mean that living conditions for men are decreasing. Aside from this, with an upcoming of equality, men's traditional roles in society are challenged, which could lead to confusion in purpose in life and thereby more depressive and suicidal thoughts.\n",

But an even stronger correlation is shown between GDI and male suicides. The blue trendline, which starts at a mere 4.8/100k suicides at a GDI of 6, goes all the way up to 18.1/100k suicides at a GDI of 1.03. This is more than three times as much, and therefore clearly supports the idea that an increase of GDI indicates an increase in male suicide.\n",

For men, however, the trendline stays relitively flat, and thereby stipulates no correlation. It therefore seems that an increase in HDI mostly improves female living conditions, while leaving male living conditions unchanged."

The figure mostly proves our previous remarks about how countries with a high GDI tend to have an increase in male suicide. As can be seen in the figure, countries labelled as LD (low development in HDI) HD (high development in GDI) signficantly contribute to the most male suicides. The second highest male suicides originate from countries labelled as HD HD (again a high development in GDI). For women, the categories mostly show no significant difference in suicides, however low development in GDI does lead to slightly less female suicide on average (more evident when zoomed in). Most importantly of all, the figure shows that this phenomenon is not merely a 'yearly fluke', but that it has been the same throughout previous years (2000 and 2010). Ultimately, this figure again suggest that a higher GDI will lead to an increase of male suicide and a slight decrease of female suicide."

    "This final of the data story, will analyse the relationship between indices of political development (democracy and political violence), and suicide. Democracy is often thought to be a sign of a country's development, leaving behind the ancient policies of tyranny or other unevenly balanced power relations. However, many countries follow under non-democratic policies, which lead to significanly different living conditions that influence mental health. The Political Violence Score (negative for peacefull - positive for violent) is another relevant indicator of living conditions, as more political violence is related to more war and oppression (e.g. enslavement, denial of human rights), which in order hold their own obvious influences on mental health. Therefore, this perspective is another interesting addition to this data story. Despite the common thought that democracy is a result of cultural and political improvement, this perspective will disprove that thought by showing how democratic countries tend to have more suicides on average, and even less HDI on average.

    "Although the relationship between happiness and civilian political involvement (in terms of democracy) is a highly philosophical one, the relation between political violence and happiness is a strongly evident one (Skywood Recovery, 2018). As our data will make clear, perhaps surprising to some, democracies tend to have a higher political violence score, which through common logic decreases the average living conditions. This circumstance might be explained with the idea that democracies, as politically complex entities, engage in intense political competition which can often lead to violent conflicts as rival groups resort to coercion or violence to achieve their goals."

Aside from that, both democratic governments have positive political violence scores, which means that they are relatively politically violent. The idea that democracy is the only policy capable of good living conditions is hereby contradicted.

    "- The first plot was not meaningful; it did not explain anything in the blink of an eye. We decided to remove the plot as a whole, and replaced it with a more meaningful graph.\n",
    "- The code-inputs were not hidden. We managed to solve this issue with some help from Teaching Assistants during phsyical classes.\n",
    "- Our Point of Views were not clear, the plots did not match one certain PoV, and the data story was not a smooth story, but it was rather unmethodically placed parts of information. To resolve this, we took a good look at our perspectives, the graphs that belong to those perspectives, and then we tried connect all pieces of loose information together into one overarching data story.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the peer feedback, we had received tips from the other two groups.\n",
    "- The graphs were hard to read, and some did not make a lot of sense. They gave examples on what would be a better and clearer understanding graph. We made sure to apply this to our graphs by adding colours, better names for the axes, which, together with the newly added captions should result in more visually appealing visualizations.\n",
    "- The combination of using the Gender Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Inequality Index (GII) made the graphs unclear whether it was a good thing that the values in the graphs raised, or a bad thing. We had therefore decided to remove GII as a whole, and only discuss GDI in the Gender Perspective. This should make are data story less confusing as a whole, and more 'simple yet meaningfull'\n",
    "- The data story did not feel like a story, but rather parts put together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We examined the feedback provided and worked on the points. Some graphs we have excluded and others we adjusted for more clarity. We worked on making the perspectives not be a separate part of the story, but more merged as a whole story."
